# splitskim

AppleScript that opens Skim in SyncTeX mode and triggers the Moom app to rearrange windows according to a snapshot specified. Both these applications must be installed.

Actually, this script calls the `displayline` script included in the Skim app. It is intended to be used when viewing a PDF file generated by LaTeX. The script must be called in this way:

    osascript splitskim.applescript line_number pdf_file tex_file snapshot-name

I designed this script to be used with Emacs, but it can be used in any advanced text editor that can run a shell command and pass the `line_number`, `pdf_file`and `tex_file` arguments to it. The first represent a line to be highlighted (supposedly the line the user is currently editing), the second is the actual PDF file Skim is opening, and the third is the LaTeX file used to generate the output file.

The fourth argument is independent of the text editor and must be created by the user as a "named snapshot" in the Moom app.

So, from the text editors you are using to edit a LaTeX file, call this script (like I said, many text editors can call a shell command), configuring the arguments properly. Skim will be opened and the windows will be arranged according to `snapshot-name`. Naturally, you can also call `splitskim` from the command line, passing arguments manually to inspect a PDF file on its own, even if you are not editing the LaTeX source.
